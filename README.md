## Analog Clock Project

This is a simple analog clock project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock dynamically updates every second to show the current time.

# Features
- **Real-time Update:** The clock hands move dynamically based on the current time.
- **CSS Styling:** The clock is styled with a glowing effect for a modern look.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Uses JavaScript to calculate and rotate the hands accordingly.

# Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# How It Works
1. The `script.js` file retrieves the current time using JavaScript's `Date` object.
2. It calculates the degree of rotation for the hour, minute, and second hands.
3. The `setInterval` function updates the clock every second.
4. The `style.css` file provides the layout and styling of the clock, including the glowing effect.
